      <h2>LOCUS OF CONTROL</h2>
      <div class="locus">
        <img class="locus-of-control" src="Images\locus of control.png" alt="locus of control">
        <p><strong>Locus of control</strong> is a psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives.</p>
        <p>Students with an “internal locus of control” generally believe that their success or failure is a result of the effort and hard work they invest in their education. Students with an “external locus of control” generally believe that their
          successes or failures result from external factors beyond their control, such as luck, fate, circumstance, injustice, bias, or teachers who are unfair, prejudiced, or unskilled. For example, students with an internal locus of control might
          blame poor grades on their failure to study, whereas students with an external locus of control may blame an unfair teacher or test for their poor performance.</p>

        <h2>POMODORO TECHNIQUE</h2>
        <img class="pomodoro-technique" src="Images\Pomodoro technique.png" alt="pomodoro technique">
        <p>The <strong>Pomodoro Method</strong> is a time management philosophy that aims to provide the user with maximum focus and creative freshness, thereby allowing them to complete projects faster with less mental fatigue.</p>
        <p>The process is simple:</p>
        <p>For every project throughout the day, you budget your time into short increments and take breaks periodically.</p>
        <p>You work for 25 minutes, then take break for five minutes.</p>
        <p>Each 25-minute work period is called a “pomodoro”, named after the Italian word for tomato. Francesco Cirillo used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato as his personal timer, and thus the method’s name.</p>
        <p>After four “pomodoros” have passed, (100 minutes of work time with 15 minutes of break time) you then take a 15-20 minute break.</p>
        <p>Every time you finish a pomodoro, you mark your progress with an “X”, and note the number of times you had the impulse to procrastinate or switch gears to work on another task for each 25-minute chunk of time.</p>

        <h2>PROCASTINATION</h2>
        <img class="procastination" src="Images\Procastination.png" alt="procastination">
        <p><strong>Procrastination</strong> is the thief of time. To put things off on purpose is known as Procrastination. They look for distractions. They on purpose fall short on performance. Every person puts off his work for some time but these
          procrastinators
          are something else. This thing also involves the degree of self-deception. Things need to be done at some time in the life even some one is too lazy.</p>
        <p>Many people confuse this term with laziness. But in fact both of these terms are very different. Procrastination is an active process in which you ignore one task deliberately and do something else. In case of laziness you don’t do
          anything. Everything is put aside. In procrastination a person chooses that task which gives more pleasure and leaves the other boring stuff. Small episodes of procrastination can make us feel awful afterwards when we are unable to achieve
          our goals. Our productivity is reduced by this.</p>

        <h2>PARETO PRINCIPLE</h2>
        <img class="pareto-principle" src="Images\Pareto Principle.png" alt="pareto principle">
        <p><strong>The Pareto principle</strong>, also known as the 80/20 rule, is a theory maintaining that 80 percent of the output from a given situation or system is determined by 20 percent of the input.</p>
        <p><strong>The Pareto Principle</strong>, also known as the 80/20 rule, is an aphorism which asserts that 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event. In business, a goal of the 80-20 rule is to
          identify inputs
          that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority. For instance, once managers identify factors that are critical to their company's success, they should give those factors the most focus.</p>
        <p>Although the 80-20 axiom is frequently used in business and economics, you can apply the concept to any field—such as wealth distribution, personal finance, spending habits, and even infidelity in personal relationships.</p>

        <p>If you’re after a way to supercharge your learning and become smarter, The Feynman Technique might just be the best way to learn absolutely anything.</p>
        <p>There are four steps to the <strong>Feynman Learning Technique:</strong></p>
        <p>1. Choose a concept you want to learn about</p>
        <p>2. Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6.</p>
        <p>3. Identify gaps in your explanation; Go back to the source material, to better understand it.</p>
        <p>4. Review and simplify</p>
